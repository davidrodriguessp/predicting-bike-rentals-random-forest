# Predicting Bike Rentals with Different Machine Learning Algorithms
The objective of this project is to build a model to predict the number of bikes rented in a specific hour, based on a series of features. We compared results from models using Linear Regression, Decision Tree and Random Forest.

The data analyzed contains 17,380 rows. Each row represents the number of bike rentals for a single hour in a specific day. The dataset can be downloaded on the University of California, Irvine's website. The file we worked with is hour.csv.

Here you can find a detailed description of the columns. cnt (count of total rental bikes) is the target variable we want to predict.

Comparing the results of multiple models, Random Forest was the algorithm which provided the best accuracy.

Two files available:
Predicting Bike Rentals.ipynb - with the complete notebook
hour.csv - with the complete dataset
